				        JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. 
				        It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. 
				        JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. 
				        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core 
				        set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. Example:
				      </p>
				      <ul>
				        <li>
				          Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
				          Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and 
				          respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries 
				          for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.
				        </li>
				        <li>
				          Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
				          Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a 
				          database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another
				           of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework 
				           which is the most famous these days is node.js.

				    <header>while statement</header>
				    <article>
				      A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
				      evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

				     	<code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
					      statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
					      statement following the loop.

					    <p>
					        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
					        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
					        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
					        control is passed to the statement following while.
					    </p>

				     	<p>
				       	To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
				        those statements.
				      	</p>

				      	Example:

				     	<p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

				      	<code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
				        <p>
				       	 	With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
				        	Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
				     	</p>

				     		 <ul>
				        	<li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
				        	<li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
				       		<li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
				     		</ul>
				      	<p>
				       		After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
				       	 	true, so the loop terminates.
				      	</p>

				      	JavaScript
						In the early days of the Internet, around 1990, Internet Explorer and 
						Netscape Navigator were the two most popular web browsers used by the general public. 
						In just 10 days, a developer named Brendan Eich at Netscape, Inc. was able to create
					    a programming language that could instruct a computer to interact with the user upon 
						receiving user input. He called this language “LiveScript” and integrated it directly
						into the navigator.
				 		
				      </p>

				      <p>
				       Java is a programming language invented by James Gosling and developed by Sun Microsystems. 
				       It took a little over 10 days to develop — it was close to four years old. In 1991, a group 
				       of Sun Microsystem engineers worked the “Green Team” day and night to create Java. It was 
				       first released in 1995, and many new versions have been launched since then. Today’s Internet 
				       is absolutely saturated with Java-based programming, and we have Java to thank for the many
				       applications that make day-to-day life easier. Java is currently owned by Oracle.
				      </p>
				      <p>
				        As they separate, there are some top-level similarities, which are worth considering,
				        especially if you are looking at web app development when comparing Java to JavaScript.
						Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Both languages require the developer to code objects 
						and their relationships in the context of each other. By extension, it gives both languages 
						access to technologies such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
				      </p>
				      <p>
				      	The Difference between java and java script is that Java is an OOP (object-oriented programming) 
				      	language that came into use in the year 1995. Java was developed at Sun Microsystems which was 
				      	later acquired by Oracle company. Those programs or applications developed in the Java programming 
				      	language will execute in a JVM (Java Virtual Machine), by which we can run the same program on 
				      	different platforms and systems or devices etc. JS is an object-oriented scripting language from
				      	which you can create dynamic HTML pages. Interactive effects within a web page. JS was available 
				      	in the browser until Google Chrome released its node engine as “node.js”.
						Both JavaScript and Java are assembled, written and executed differently, and each has a dramatic
						difference when it comes to what it’s capable of.

				      To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
				      first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
				      <code
				        >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
				        greetMe("World");

				  <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
				    <header>Variables</header>
				    <p>
				      You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
				      names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				      A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
				      dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
				      JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
				      "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
				    </p>
				    <p>
				      You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
				      You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
				      identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
				      _name.
				    </p>
				  </section>
				  <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
				    <header>Declaring variables</header>
				    <article>
				      You can declare a variable in three ways:
				      <p>
				        With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
				        can be used to declare both local and global variables.
				      </p>
				      <p>
				        By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
				        always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
				        warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
				      </p>
				      <p>
				        With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
				        can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
				        below.
				      </p>
				    </article>
				  </section>
				  <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
				    <header>Variable scope</header>
				    <article>
				      <p>
				        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
				        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
				        current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
				        called a local variable, because it is available only within that
				        function.
				      </p>

				      <p>
				        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
				        rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
				        global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
				        code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
				        context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
				        is an if statement.
				      </p>
				      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
				      <p>
				        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
				        ECMAScript 2015.
				      </p>

				      <code
				        >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
				        defined</code
				      >
				    </article>
				  </section>
				  <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
				    <header>Global variables</header>
				    <article>
				      <p>
				        Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
				        pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
				        variables using the window.variable syntax.
				      </p>

				      <p>
				        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
				        frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
				        name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
				        document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
				        parent.phoneNumber.
				      </p>
				    </article>
				  </section>
				  <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
				    <header>Constants</header>
				    <article>
				      <p>
				        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
				        syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
				        identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
				        can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
				      </p>

				      <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
				      <p>
				        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
				        while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
				      </p>

				      <p>
				        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
				        variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
				        represent a variable.
				      </p>

				      <p>
				        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
				        variable in the same scope. For example:
				      </p>

				      <code
				        >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
				        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
				        }</code
				      >
				      However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
				      is executed without problems.
				      <code
				        >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code
				      >

				  <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
				    <header>Data types</header>
				    <article>
				      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
				      <ul>
				        <li>
				          <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
				          <ul>
				            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
				            <li>
				              null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
				              is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
				              other variant.
				            </li>
				            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
				            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
				            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
				            <li>
				              Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
				              unique and immutable.
				            </li>
				          </ul>
				        </li>

				        <li>and Object</li>
				      </ul>
				      Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
				      to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
				      are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
				      objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
				      your application can perform.
